# TicTacToe
A 2-Player Strategy Game for Android. This app was created using Java and Android Studio. 
It was designed and implemented with simple and interactive activities that adhere to good ethical and UI design practices.
We implemented the back-end which utilized software design concepts such as data structures, event handlers and object-oriented programming. 
Each Activity was designed in XML and was bridged to the code through various event handlers. 
We had also designed each graphical aspect such as icon and App Store banners using Adobe Photoshop

WHAT'S NEXT: Currently implementing a single-player mode that utilizes algorithms to play against the user
